        <p>I became passionate about energy sometimes back (renewable energy to be precise) after my undergraduate project as it was basically
        and fully on the installation of power system, a system that has the capability of converting solar energy into electrical energy.
        Ergo, generating electricity.</p> Over the years, there has been a serious lament and outcry over epileptic power supply.<br>
        <p>An upcoming company Naslite promises to profer solution to this power challenges faced by organizations, offices, schools,
        hospitals both public and private sectors.</p> I dream of a country, A solar Nigria. I dream of a continent, A solar Africa.<br>
